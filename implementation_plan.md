# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the Next.js application that includes automation, security scanning, performance monitoring, API testing, deployment automation, and self-learning capabilities through automated feedback loops. This will enhance development workflow, ensure code quality, and enable reliable deployments while incorporating security best practices and performance optimizations.

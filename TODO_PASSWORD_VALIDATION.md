## API Usage Examples

### Client Registration
```bash
POST /api/auth/client/register
{

  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "company": "ABC Corp",
  "phone": "+1234567890"

```

### Admin Registration

  "fullName": "Bob Johnson",
  "adminLevel": "admin",
  "phone": "+1234567890"
}
```

## Notes
- All endpoints use Supabase service role for admin operations
- Passwords are validated before user creation
- Failed profile creation triggers cleanup of auth user
- All new accounts are auto-verified and active
- Registration is logged to console for monitoring

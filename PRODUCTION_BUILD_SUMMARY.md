# Production Build Summary

## What Has Been Accomplished

1. **Supabase Migration Preparation**
   - Created a consolidated schema file: `supabase_consolidated_schema_for_migration.sql`
   - Created a migration guide: `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Created step-by-step migration instructions: `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_STEPS.md`
   - Installed and configured Supabase CLI

2. **Mock Data Replacement**
   - Created a production-ready SQL file with placeholder data: `complete_supabase_setup_production.sql`
   - Replaced sample data with "updating soon" placeholders for:
     - Services
     - Team members
     - FAQs

3. **Migration Files**
   - Created migration file with timestamp: `supabase/migrations/20250922163825_consolidated_schema.sql`

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Link your Supabase project (replace YOUR_PROJECT_REF with your actual reference)
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Push the database schema
supabase db push
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Update your `.env.local` file with actual Supabase credentials:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-actual-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-service-role-key
```

### 3. Frontend Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Deployment
Deploy the built application to your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
